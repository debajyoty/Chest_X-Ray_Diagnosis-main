contains the training, validation, test sets and the chest x-ray images for gradcam visualization2) `train.py` or `train.ipynb`  -  contains the code for training the model3) `test.py` or ` test.ipynb`  - contains the code for testing the model4) `util.py` - contains different utility functions that are not connectedin anyway to the model presented, but rather help inprocessing the outputs into a more understandable way.5) `densenet.hdf5` - contains the densenet model, on which our model is built6) `pretrained_model.hdf5` - contains the model weights after training### Location of the code and pre-trained modelUpload the folder `Chest_X-Ray_Diagnosis-main` in  location `/content/drive/My Drive/`Location of Densenet Model : `/content/drive/My Drive/Chest_X-Ray_Diagnosis-main/Codes and Pre-trained Model/densenet.hdf5`Location of Pretrained Model : `/content/drive/My Drive/Chest_X-Ray_Diagnosis-main/Codes and Pre-trained Model/pretrained_model.h5`Location of `train.py` : `/content/drive/My Drive/Chest_X-Ray_Diagnosis-main/Codes and Pre-trained Model/train.py``Alternatively` Location of `train.ipynb` : `/content/drive/My Drive/Chest_X-Ray_Diagnosis-main/Codes and Pre-trained Model/train.ipynb`Location of `util.py` : `/content/drive/My Drive/Chest_X-Ray_Diagnosis-main/Codes and Pre-trained Model/util.py`Location of `test.py` : `/content/drive/My Drive/Chest_X-Ray_Diagnosis-main/Codes and Pre-trained Model/test.py``Alternatively`Location of `test.ipynb` : `/content/drive/My Drive/Chest_X-Ray_Diagnosis-main/Codes and Pre-trained Model/test.ipynb`Location of Training dataset : `/content/drive/My Drive/Chest_X-Ray_Diagnosis-main/Codes and Pre-trained Model/preprocessed_dataset/train-small.csv`Location of Validation dataset : `/content/drive/My Drive/Chest_X-Ray_Diagnosis-main/Codes and Pre-trained Model/preprocessed_dataset/valid-small.csv`Location of Test dataset : `/content/drive/My Drive/Chest_X-Ray_Diagnosis-main/Codes and Pre-trained Model/preprocessed_dataset/test.csv`Location of Chest X-Ray Images for Gradcam Visualization:`/content/drive/My Drive/Chest_X-Ray_Diagnosis-main/Codes and Pre-trained Model/preprocessed_dataset/images-small`Upload the `util.py` file in the `content` section of the Google Colab Notebook For Uploading the files required in Google Colab:  `from google.colab import drivedrive.mount('/content/drive')`## DataSet: ChestX-ray14 dataset is used which contains 112,120 frontal-view X-ray images of 30,805 unique patients.We have preprocessed this dataset (csv files) to use it for our model by preventing data leakage and overlap of patients, normalizing the mean and standard deviation, shuffling the input after each epoch, set the image size to be 320px by 320px.Further details about how the dataset was pre-processed can be found in the paper.## Code Implementation:### DenseNet121:   We have used a pre-trained DenseNet121 model which we have loaded directly from Keras and then add two layers on top of it:  ### Training: The `densenet.hdf5` file is used for building the model architecture.  If the user wants to train the model, run all the cells of `train.ipynb` by pressing ctrl+enter at each cell. The weights of the pre-trained model are automatically stored in the `my_model.h5` file in the location `/content/drive/My Drive/Chest_X-Ray_Diagnosis-main/Codes and Pre-trained Model/`  ,which can be used for testing.A pre-trained model namely `pretrained_model.h5` has already been made for testing purposes.   `Alternatively`Upload the `train.py` file in the `content` section of the Google Colab Notebook  Input the command `!python train.py` in one of the cells of the Google Colab Notebook and press  ctrl+enter  to run the training file.### Testing and Evaluating:      The `pretrained_model.h5` file is used for loading the weights of the pre-trained model and is used for testing.     To use the pre-trained model and evaluate it, run all the cells of  `test.ipynb` by pressing ctrl+enter at each cell   `Alternatively`Upload the `test.py` file in the `content` section of the Google Colab Notebook  Input the command `!python test.py` in one of the cells of the Google Colab Notebook and press  ctrl+enter  to run the test file.  ### Visualizing Learning with GradCAM:   One of the most common approaches aimed at increasing the interpretability of models for computer vision tasks is to use Class Activation Maps (CAM).   It can be visualized while executing the `test.ipynb` file.
